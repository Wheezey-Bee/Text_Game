Hello, this repository is for my chatbot text game. I started off with a framework from a coffee shop bot project on codecademy and adapted it to a typical quest storyline. I'm working on adding randomised features and introducing stats to the user which will also affect the story outcome. This will be a long project but now that I have got the beginning up and running, I am sharing it on here!

On the 10th January, I've just got stats working in main body and prologue. However, I've found that one of the options in prologue causes a loop. Next time, I am going to work on fixing this loop and hopefully complete chapter 1 of the story.

On the 1st February, I've found an issue with importing the chapter one file to the prologue file. I've been trying different things out but nothing has worked. I think this issue would be solved by putting all of the python code into one file, however I am worried about potentially slowing the project down as it gets larger. I will look more into joining files or using a single file over the coming week.

On the 6th February, I tested having all of the code in a single file - aptly named 'tester'. This file got further through the story but i am having trouble adding items to the inventory inside the stats dictionary. As I am still looking at whether to keep one file or many, I did not look too deeply into solving the problem this time. When I work on this next, I will come to my final decision.

Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my code!
