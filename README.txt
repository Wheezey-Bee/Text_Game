Hello, this repository is for my chatbot text game. I started off with a framework from a coffee shop bot project on codecademy and adapted it to a typical quest storyline. I'm working on adding randomised features and introducing stats to the user which will also affect the story outcome. This will be a long project but once I get stats working, I'm sure the pace will pick up quickly! 

Thanks for having a look!
